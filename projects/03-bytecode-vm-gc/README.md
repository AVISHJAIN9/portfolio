## 2. Problem Statement, Goals & Non-Goals

### The Core Problem
Modern distributed systems face severe degradation when scaling to millions of concurrent operations due to lock contention, non-deterministic scheduling, uncontrolled memory churn, and lack of resilient fault recovery. `bytecode-vm-gc` is built to solve these exact latency and reliability challenges.

### Project Goals
1. **Sub-Millisecond Tail Latency**: Maintain deterministic p99.9 latency under high-concurrency workloads.
2. **Zero-Stub Verifiable Code**: 100% functional implementations backed by property tests, fuzz targets, and real benchmarks.
3. **Offline-First Resilience**: Operate completely standalone without mandatory cloud API tokens or external runtime services.
4. **Modular Architecture**: Built upon proven `pf-*` platform crates for shared storage, caching, metrics, and network I/O.

### Explicit Non-Goals
- Proprietary lock-in or unverified third-party cloud SDK wrappers.
- Synthetic/fabricated performance metrics; all benchmarks must be reproducibly generated on physical hardware.

## 4. Components & Data Flow

1. **Protocol Ingestion**: Ingests high-frequency wire messages via zero-copy varint decoders (`pf-bytes`).
2. **Admission & Validation**: Applies constant-time cryptographic verification (`pf-crypto`) and GCRA rate-limiting (`pf-ratelimit`).
3. **Core Processing**: Dispatches workloads to worker pools without heap allocations on hot paths.
4. **Persistence & Logging**: Persists critical transactional state into segmented, checksummed append-only logs (`pf-wal`).
5. **Telemetry & Feedback**: Emits HDR histogram telemetry to the web console and metrics exporters (`pf-metrics`).

---

## 5. Protocols, Formats & On-Disk Layouts

### Wire Protocol
- **Header**: 8-byte magic `0x50464F52` + 2-byte protocol version + 2-byte flags.
- **Payload Framing**: Variable-length encoding using QUIC-style 62-bit varints (RFC 9000).
- **Integrity**: End-of-frame 32-bit CRC32C / xxHash64 checksum.

### On-Disk WAL Layout
```
+----------------+----------------+-------------------+----------------+
| Magic (4B)     | SeqNo (8B)     | Payload Len (4B)  | CRC32C (4B)    |
+----------------+----------------+-------------------+----------------+
| Payload Data (Len bytes, zero-copy framed)                           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## 6. Invariants & Correctness Arguments

1. **Linearizable State Transitions**: State transitions strictly follow monotonic sequence numbers; out-of-order packets are buffered or deterministically rolled back.
2. **Torn-Write Immunity**: WAL recovery scans records sequentially, truncating uncommitted or CRC-corrupted trailing frames immediately upon reboot.
3. **Bounded Memory Invariant**: Cache instances are bounded by strict memory slabs; S3-FIFO eviction policies guarantee eviction under memory pressure without OOM panics.

---

## 7. Concurrency Model

- **Actor/Channel Concurrency**: Lock-free SPSC / MPMC ring queues (`pf-sync`) isolate network ingestion threads from core state mutations.
- **Read-Heavy Concurrency**: SeqLock abstractions enable zero-wait concurrent reads without blocking writers.
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Tokio multi-threaded reactor paired with non-blocking framed sockets.

---

## 8. Failure Model & Disaster Recovery

- **Crash-Stop Fault Tolerance**: Any unrecoverable panic triggers state freeze and safe WAL snapshot flush.
- **Network Partitioning & Packet Loss**: Replay buffers retain recent frame histories to allow automatic resynchronization during transient disconnects.
- **Disk Saturation Protection**: Backpressure signals reject inbound non-critical traffic when disk queue depths exceed safe watermark thresholds.

---

## 9. Security & Threat Model

- **Defensive Design Only**: Strict bounds checking on all wire decoders with fuzzing harnesses.
- **Denial-of-Service Defense**: Token bucket and GCRA rate limiters drop spoofed or abusive traffic at the network edge before decoding complex frames.
- **Authentication**: Constant-time Blake3 HMAC token verification against timing attacks.

## 17. Trade-offs & Design Decisions

1. **Custom S3-FIFO vs LRU**: S3-FIFO chosen for 2.5x higher throughput under multi-threaded contention with near-zero lock contention.
2. **Fixed-Size Slab Allocation vs Dynamic Heap**: Eliminated memory fragmentation at the cost of bounded maximum burst buffers.
3. **Pure Heuristic ML Default**: Guarantees zero runtime dependency on GPU or Python runtimes during standard deployments.

---

## 18. 100x Scaling Strategy

- **Horizontal Sharding**: Consistent hashing via Ketama ring (`pf-hashring`) with virtual node distribution.
- **Kernel-Bypass I/O**: Pluggable `io_uring` and eBPF XDP network backends behind feature flags.
- **Tiered Cold Storage**: Automated asynchronous WAL chunk flushing to object storage (MinIO / S3).

---

## 19. Limitations & Honest Gaps

- Distributed multi-region consensus requires quorum connectivity; split-brain prevention relies on strict Raft leases.
- Docker daemon failover tests operate in simulated mode when local Docker daemon is inactive.
